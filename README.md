- 👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Brown. I am currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science with a concentration in natural language processing (NLP) at Syracuse University. I work
-      for an NIH-funded lab that researches asthma pathogenesis, treatments and personalized medicine. I especially enjoy implementing software for this role.  My 
-      interests outside of work includes basketball, tennis, hiking, field mycology and history.  
-   
- 👀 I’m interested in predictive modeling and NLP. Specifically I am interested in machine learning algorithms, neural networks and regression modeling to extract
-       useful information to make decisions in industry. My NLP interests include extracting useful information from reviews to optimize products and services,
-       identifying bots and storing them in a database to disclude their entries from text analysis, and detecting and identifying the source of propaganda and
-       misinformation. Similarly, I am interested in using NLP to use text meaning and determine veracity of statements by checking their meaning against a database.
-     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning techniques in regression analysis, machine learning and NLP. So far all of my work has been in R. 
- 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any projects that touch on my interests above or develop skills associated with predictive modeling and NLP.
